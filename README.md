This folder will contain both the mechanical and eletronics files required to build 
the thrust stand. 
The 3d model parts are modelled using Solidworks.
The electronics will be designed using Altium Designer. 

## Software
This folder will contain the software required to run the thrust stand.
The embedded software will be written in C/C++ and will be compiled using the GNU C/C++ compiler.
The GUI will be written in WebAssembly and will be compiled using Emscripten. 

## Documentation
This folder will contain all the documentation required to build the thrust stand.

## Images
